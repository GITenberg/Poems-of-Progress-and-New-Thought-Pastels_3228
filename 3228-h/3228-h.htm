<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE<br />
LOVE&rsquo;S LANGUAGE</h2>
<p class="poetry">When silence flees before the voice of Love,<br
/>
Of what expression does that god approve?<br />
Is dulcet song or flowing verse his choice,<br />
Or stately prose, made regal by his voice?<br />
Speaks Love in couplets, or in epics grand?<br />
And is Love humble, or does he command?</p>
<p class="poetry">There is no language that Love does not
speak:<br />
To-day commanding and to-morrow meek,<br />
One hour laconic and the next verbose,<br />
With hope triumphant and with doubt morose,<br />
His varying moods all forms of speech employ.<br />
To give expression to his painful joy,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>To voice the phases of his joyful pain,<br />
He rings the changes on the poet&rsquo;s strain.<br />
Yet not in epic, epigram or verse<br />
Can Love the passion of his heart rehearse.<br />
All speech, all language, is inadequate,<br />
There are no words with Love commensurate.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE LAND
BETWEEN</h2>
<p class="poetry">Between the little Here and larger Yonder,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a realm (or so one day I read)<br />
Where faithful spirits love-enchained may wander,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till some remembering soul from earth has fled.<br
/>
Then, reunited, they go forth afar,<br />
From sphere to sphere, where wondrous angels are.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not many spirits in that realm are waiting;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not many pause upon its shores to rest;<br />
For only love, intense and unabating,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can hold them from the longer, higher quest.<br />
And after grief has wept itself to sleep,<br />
Few hearts on earth their vital memories keep.</p>
<p class="poetry">Should I pass on, across the mystic border,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let thy love link me to that pallid land;<br />
I would not seek the heavens of finer order<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until thy barque had left this coarser strand.<br />
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>How desolate
such journeyings would be,<br />
Though straight to Him, were they not shared by thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">Wert thou first called (dear God, how could I
bear it?)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I should enchain thee with my love, I know.<br />
Not great enough am I to free thy spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From all these tender ties, and bid thee go.<br />
Nor would a soul, unselfish as thine own,<br />
Forget so soon, and speed to heaven alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">On earth we find no joy in ways diverging;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How could we find it in the worlds unseen?<br />
I know old memories from my bosom surging,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would keep thee waiting in that Land Between,<br />
Until together, side by side, we trod<br />
A path of stars, in our great search for God.</p>

3</span>LOVE&rsquo;S MIRAGE</h2>
<p class="poetry">Midway upon the route, he paused athirst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And suddenly across the wastes of heat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw cool waters gleaming, and a sweet<br />
Green oasis upon his vision burst.<br />
A tender dream, long in his bosom nursed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spread love&rsquo;s illusive verdure for his
feet;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The barren sands changed into golden wheat;<br />
The way grew glad that late had seemed accursed.</p>
<p class="poetry">She shone, the woman wonder, on his soul;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden spot, for which men toil and wait;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house of rest, that is each
heart&rsquo;s demand;<br />
But when, at last, he reached the gleaming goal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He found, oh, cruel irony of fate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But desert sun upon the desert
sand.</p>

OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p class="poetry">I know the need of the world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though it would not have me know.<br />
It would hide its sorrow deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where only God may go.<br />
Yet its secret it can not keep;<br />
It tells it awake, or asleep,<br />
It tells it to all who will heed,<br />
And he who runs may read.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The need of the world I know.</p>
<p class="poetry">I know the need of the world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When it boasts of its wealth the loudest,<br />
When it flaunts it in all men&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When its mien is the gayest and proudest.<br />
Oh! ever it lies&mdash;it lies,<br />
For the sound of its laughter dies<br />
In a sob and a smothered moan,<br />
And it weeps when it sits alone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The need of the world I know.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>I know the need of the world.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the earth shakes under the tread<br />
Of men who march to the fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When rivers with blood are red<br />
And there is no law but might,<br />
And the wrong way seems the right;<br />
When he who slaughters the most<br />
Is all men&rsquo;s pride and boast.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The need of the world I know.</p>
<p class="poetry">I know the need of the world.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When it babbles of gold and fame,<br />
It is only to lead us astray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the thing that it dare not name,<br />
For this is the sad world&rsquo;s way.<br />
Oh! poor blind world grown grey<br />
With the need of a thing so near,<br />
With the want of a thing so dear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The need of the world I know.</p>
<p class="poetry">The need of the world is love.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep under the pride of power,<br />
Down under its lust of greed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the joys that last but an hour,<br />
There lies forever its need.<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>For love is
the law and the creed<br />
And love is the unnamed goal<br />
Of life, from man to the mole.<br />

STREAM</h2>
<p class="poetry">Skilled mariner, and counted sane and wise,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a curious thing which chanced to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So good a sailor on so fair a
sea.<br />
With favouring winds and blue unshadowed skies,<br />
Led by the faithful beacon of Love&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Past reef and shoal, my life-boat bounded free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fearless of all changes that might be<br />
Under calm waves, where many a sunk rock lies.</p>
<p class="poetry">A golden dawn; yet suddenly my barque<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strained at the sails, as in a cyclone&rsquo;s
blast;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And battled with an unseen
current&rsquo;s force,<br />
For we had entered when the night was dark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That old tempestuous Gulf Stream of the Past.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for love&rsquo;s eyes, I had
not kept the course.</p>

<p class="poetry">His art was loving; Eres set his sign<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon that youthful forehead, and he drew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hearts of women, as the sun
draws dew.<br />
Love feeds love&rsquo;s thirst as wine feeds love of wine;<br />
Nor is there any potion from the vine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which makes men drunken like the subtle brew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of kisses crushed by kisses; and he grew<br />
Inebriated with that draught divine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet in his sober moments, when the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of radiant summer paled to lonely fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And passion&rsquo;s sea had grown
an ebbing tide,<br />
From out the many, Memory singled one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full cup that seemed the sweetest of them
all&mdash;<br />

him and denied</i>.</p>

<p class="poetry">The world an abject vassal to her charms,<br />
And kings competing for a single smile,<br />
Yet love she knew not, till upon this isle<br />
She gave surrender to abducting arms.<br />
Not Theseus, who plucked her lips&rsquo; first kiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not Menelaus, lawful mate and spouse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such answering passion in her heart could rouse,<br

Or wake such tumult in her soul as this.<br />
Let come what will, let Greece and Asia meet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let heroes die and kingdoms run with gore;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let devastation spread from shore to shore&mdash;<br

Resplendent Helen finds her bondage sweet.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of faithful Menelaus long bereft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Time is the only suitor who is left:<br />
Helen survives, with youth and beauty fled.<br />
By hate remembered, but by love forgot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dethroned and driven from her high estate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unhappy Helen feels the lash of Fate<br />
And knows at last an unloved woman&rsquo;s lot.<br />
The Grecian marvel, and the Trojan joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world&rsquo;s fair wonder, from her palace
flies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The furies follow, and great Helen dies,<br />
A death of horror, for the pride of Troy.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Lais, whose beauty was the fateful light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That led great ships to anchor in
the night<br />
And bring their priceless cargoes to her bower,<br />
Lais yet found her cup of sweet turned sour.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Great Plato&rsquo;s pupil, from his lofty height,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Zenocrates, unmoved, had seen the white<br />
Sweet wonder of her, and defied her power.</p>
<p class="poetry">She snared the world in nets of subtle
wiles:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The proud, the famed, all clamoured at her gate;<br

Wisdom sought madness, in her favouring smiles;<br />

One tossed her coins; she took them and passed on.<br />
Down by the harbour sloped a terraced lawn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where fountains played; she paused to view the
scene.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A marble palace stood in bowers of green<br />
&rsquo;Twas here of old she revelled till the dawn.</p>

came&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hero and statesman, athlete, merchant, sage;<br />

To buy her favour and exalt her shame.</p>

<h3>I</h3>
<p class="poetry">Sailing away on a summer sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the bleak March weather;<br />
Drifting away for a loaf and play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just you and I together;<br />
And it&rsquo;s good-bye worry and good-bye hurry<br />
And never a care have we;<br />
With the sea below and the sun above<br />
And nothing to do but dream and love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sailing away together.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sailing away from the grim old town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tasks the town calls duty;<br />
Sailing away from walls of grey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To a land of bloom and beauty,<br />
And it&rsquo;s good-bye to letters from our lessers and our
betters,<br />
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>To the
cold world&rsquo;s smile or its frown.<br />
We sail away on a sunny track<br />
To find the summer and bring it back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And love is our only duty.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="poetry">Afloat on a sea of passion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a compass or chart,<br />
But the glow of your eye shows the sun is high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the sextant of my heart.<br />
I know we are nearing the tropics<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the languor that round us lies,<br />
And the smile on your mouth says the course is south<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the port is Paradise.</p>
<p class="poetry">We have left grey skies behind us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We sail under skies of blue;<br />
You are off with me on lovers&rsquo; sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I am away with you.<br />
We have not a single sorrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I have but one fear&mdash;<br />
That my lips may miss one offered kiss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the mouth that is smiling near.</p>

<h3>I</h3>
<p class="poetry">I wrenched from a passing comet in its
flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By that great force of two mad hearts aflame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A soul incarnate, back to earth you came,<br />
To glow like star-dust for a little night.<br />
Deep shadows hide you wholly from our sight;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The centuries leave nothing but your name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tinged with the lustre of a splendid shame,<br />
That blazed oblivion with rebellious light.</p>
<p class="poetry">The mighty passion that became your cause,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Still burns its lengthening path across the
years;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We feel its raptures, and we see its tears<br />
And ponder on its retributive laws.<br />

It needed but my woman&rsquo;s heart to tell<br />
Of those long vigils and the tears that fell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When aching arms reached out in fruitless quest,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; As after flight, wings brood an empty nest.<br />
(So well I know that sorrow, ah, so well.)</p>
<p class="poetry">Across the centuries there comes no sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that vast anguish; not one sigh or word<br />

The sea of silence, lasting and profound.<br />

He must provide for all earth&rsquo;s cheated mothers<br />

COST</h2>
<p class="poetry">God finished woman in the twilight hour<br />
And said, &lsquo;To-morrow thou shalt find thy place:<br />
Man&rsquo;s complement, the mother of the race&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With love the motive power&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The one compelling power.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">All night she dreamed and wondered.&nbsp; With
the light<br />
Her lover came&mdash;and then she understood<br />
The purpose of her being.&nbsp; Life was good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the world seemed right&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nothing was, but right.</p>
<p class="poetry">She had no wish for any wider sway:<br />
By all the questions of the world unvexed,<br />
Supremely loving and superbly sexed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed upon her way&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her feminine fair way.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>But God neglected, when He fashioned man,<br />
To fuse the molten splendour of his mind<br />
With that sixth sense He gave to womankind.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so He marred His plan&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, marred His own great plan.</p>
<p class="poetry">She asked so little, and so much she gave,<br
/>
That man grew selfish: and she soon became,<br />
To God&rsquo;s great sorrow and the whole world&rsquo;s shame,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s sweet and patient slave&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His uncomplaining slave.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet in the nights (oh! nights so dark and
long)<br />
She clasped her little children to her breast<br />
And wept.&nbsp; And in her anguish of unrest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought upon her wrong;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She knew how great her wrong.</p>
<p class="poetry">And one sad hour, she said unto her heart,<br
/>
&lsquo;Since thou art cause of all my bitter pain,<br />
I bid thee abdicate the throne: let brain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule now, and do his part&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His masterful, strong part.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She wept no more.&nbsp; By new ambition
stirred<br />
Her ways led out, to regions strange and vast.<br />

sphere,<br />
Till thorny paths bloomed with the rose of fame.<br />
Who once demurred, now followed with acclaim:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hiss died in the cheer&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The loud applauding cheer.</p>
<p class="poetry">She stood triumphant in that radiant hour,<br

Man&rsquo;s mental equal, and competitor.<br />

<p class="poetry">I dreamed a Voice, of one God-authorised,<br />
Cried loudly thro&rsquo; the world, &lsquo;Disarm!&nbsp;
Disarm!&rsquo;<br />
And there was consternation in the camps;<br />
And men who strutted under braid and lace<br />
Beat on their medalled breasts, and wailed,
&lsquo;Undone!&rsquo;<br />
The word was echoed from a thousand hills,<br />
And shop and mill, and factory and forge,<br />
Where throve the awful industries of death,<br />
Hushed into silence.&nbsp; Scrawled upon the doors,<br />
The passer read, &lsquo;Peace bids her children starve.&rsquo;<br
/>
But foolish women clasped their little sons<br />
And wept for joy, not reasoning like men.</p>
<p class="poetry">Again the Voice commanded: &lsquo;Now go
forth<br />
And build a world for Progress and for Peace.<br />
This work has waited since the earth was shaped;<br />
But men were fighting, and they could not toil.<br />
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>The needs
of life outnumber needs of death.<br />
Leave death with God.&nbsp; Go forth, I say, and

<p class="poetry">And then a sudden, comprehensive joy<br />
Shone in the eyes of men; and one who thought<br />
Only of conquests and of victories<br />
Woke from his gloomy reverie and cried,<br />
&lsquo;Ay, come and build!&nbsp; I challenge all to try.<br />
And I will make a world more beautiful<br />
Than Eden was before the serpent came.&rsquo;<br />
And like a running flame on western wilds,<br />
Ambition spread from mind to listening mind,<br />
And lo! the looms were busy once again,<br />
And all the earth resounded with men&rsquo;s toil.</p>
<p class="poetry">Vast palaces of Science graced the world;<br />
Their banquet tables spread with feasts of truth<br />
For all who hungered.&nbsp; Music kissed the air,<br />
Once rent with boom of cannons.&nbsp; Statues gleamed<br />
From wooded ways, where ambushed armies hid<br />
In times of old.&nbsp; The sea and air were gay<br />
With shining sails that soared from land to land.<br />
A universal language of the world<br />
Made nations kin, and poverty was known</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

war.<br />
The arts were kindled with celestial fire;<br />
New poets sang so Homer&rsquo;s fame grew dim;<br />
And brush and chisel gave the wondering race<br />
Sublimer treasures than old Greece displayed.<br />
Men differed still; fierce argument arose,<br />
For men are human in this human sphere;<br />
But unarmed Arbitration stood between<br />
And Reason settled in a hundred hours<br />
What War disputed for a hundred years.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, that a Voice, of one God-authorised<br />

<p class="poetry">Once in a time of trouble and of care<br />
I dreamed I talked with God about my pain;<br />
With sleepland courage, daring to complain<br />
Of what I deemed ungracious and unfair.<br />
&lsquo;Lord, I have grovelled on my knees in prayer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hour after hour,&rsquo; I cried; &lsquo;yet all in
vain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No hand leads up to heights I would attain,<br />
No path is shown me out of my despair.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then answered God: &lsquo;Three things I gave
to thee&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clear brain, brave will, and strength of mind and
heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All implements divine, to shape
the way.<br />
Why shift the burden of thy toil on Me?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till to the utmost he has done his part<br />

EDICT OF THE SEX</h2>
<p class="poetry">Two thousand years had passed since Christ was
born,<br />
When suddenly there rose a mighty host<br />
Of women, sweeping to a central goal<br />
As many rivers sweep on to the sea.<br />
They came from mountains, valleys, and from coasts,<br />
And from all lands, all nations, and all ranks,<br />
Speaking all languages, but thinking one.<br />
And that one language&mdash;Peace.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Listen,&rsquo;
they said,<br />
And straightway was there silence on the earth,<br />
For men were dumb with wonder and surprise.<br />
&lsquo;Listen, O mighty masters of the world,<br />
And hear the edict of all womankind:<br />
Since Christ His new commandment gave to men,<br />
<i>Love one another</i>, full two thousand years<br />
Have passed away, yet earth is red with blood.<br />
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>The strong
male rulers of the world proclaim<br />
Their weakness, when we ask that war shall cease.<br />
Now will the poor weak women of the world<br />
Proclaim their strength, and say that war shall end.<br />
Hear, then, our edict: Never from this day<br />
Will any woman on the crust of earth<br />
Mother a warrior.&nbsp; We have sworn the oath<br />
And will go barren to the waiting tomb<br />
Rather than breed strong sons at war&rsquo;s behest,<br />
Or bring fair daughters into life, to bear<br />
The pains of travail, for no end but war.<br />
Ay! let the race die out for lack of babes<br />
Better a dying race than endless wars!<br />
Better a silent world than noise of guns<br />
And clash of armies.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Long
we asked for peace,<br />
And oft you promised&mdash;but to fight again.<br />
At last you told us, war must ever be<br />
While men existed, laughing at our plea<br />
For the disarmament of all mankind.<br />
Then in our hearts flamed such a mad desire<br />
For peace on earth, as lights the world at times<br />
With some great conflagration; and it spread<br />
From distant land to land, from sea to sea,<br />
<a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Until all
women thought as with one mind<br />
And spoke as with one voice; and now behold!<br />
The great Crusading Syndicate of Peace,<br />
Filling all space with one supreme resolve.<br />
Give us, O men, your word that war shall end:<br />
Disarm the world, and we will give you sons&mdash;<br />
Sons to construct, and daughters to adorn<br />
A beautiful new earth, where there shall be<br />
Fewer and finer people, opulence<br />
And opportunity and peace for all.<br />
Until you promise peace no shrill birth-cry<br />
Shall sound again upon the aging earth.<br />
We wait your answer.&rsquo;</p>

WORLD-CHILD</h2>
<p class="poetry">At times I am the mother of the world;<br />
And mine seem all its sorrows, and its fears.<br />
That rose, which in each mother-heart is curled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rose of pity, opens with my tears,<br />
And, waking in the night, I lie and hark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the lone sobbing, and the wild alarms,<br />
Of my World-child, a wailing in the dark:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The child I fain would shelter in my arms.<br />
I call to it (as from another room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A mother calls, what time she cannot go):<br />
&lsquo;Sleep well, dear world; Love hides behind this gloom.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no need for wakefulness or woe,<br />
The long, long night is almost past and gone,<br />
The day is near.&rsquo;&nbsp; And yet the world weeps on.</p>
<p class="poetry">Again I follow it, throughout the day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With anxious eyes I see it trip and fall,<br />
<a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>And hurt
itself in many a foolish way:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Childlike, unheeding warning word or call.<br />
I see it grasp, and grasping, break the toys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It cried to own, then toss them on the floor<br />
And, breathless, hurry after fancied joys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That cease to please, when added to its store.<br />
I see the lacerations on its hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made by forbidden tools; but when it weeps,<br />
I also weep, as one who understands;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And having been a child, the memory keeps.<br />
Ah, my poor world, however wrong thy part,<br />
Still is there pity in my mother-heart.</p>

<p class="poetry">I love this age of energy and force,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Expectantly I greet each pregnant hour;<br />
Emerging from the all-creative source,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Supreme with promise, imminent with power.<br />
The strident whistle and the clanging bell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The noise of gongs, the rush of motored things<br />
Are but the prophet voices which foretell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A time when thought may use unfettered wings.</p>
<p class="poetry">Too long the drudgery of earth has been<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A barrier &rsquo;twixt man and his own mind.<br />
Remove the stone, and lo! the Christ within;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For He is there, and who so seeks shall find.<br />
The Great Inventor is the Modern Priest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He paves the pathway to a higher goal.<br />
Once from the grind of endless toil released<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Man will explore the kingdom of his soul.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; This noise and glare is but the fanfarade<br />
That ushers in the more majestic life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where faith shall walk with science, unafraid.<br />
I feel the strong vibrations of the earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I sense the coming of an hour sublime,<br />
And bless the star that watched above my birth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And let me live in this important time.</p>

LADDER</h2>
<p class="poetry">Unto each mortal who comes to earth<br />
A ladder is given by God, at birth,<br />
And up this ladder the soul must go,<br />
Step by step, from the valley below;<br />
Step by step, to the centre of space,<br />
On this ladder of lives, to the Starting Place.</p>
<p class="poetry">In time departed (which yet endures)<br />
I shaped my ladder, and you shaped yours.<br />
Whatever they are&mdash;they are what we made:<br />
A ladder of light, or a ladder of shade,<br />
A ladder of love, or a hateful thing,<br />
A ladder of strength, or a wavering string.<br />
A ladder of gold, or a ladder of straw,<br />
Each is the ladder of righteous law.</p>
<p class="poetry">We flung them away at the call of death,<br />
We took them again with the next life breath.<br />
For a keeper stands by the great birth gates;<br />
As each soul passes, its ladder waits.<br />
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Though
mine be narrow, and yours be broad,<br />
On my ladder alone can I climb to God.<br />
On your ladder alone can your feet ascend,<br />
For none may borrow, and none may lend.</p>
<p class="poetry">If toil and trouble and pain are found,<br />
Twisted and corded, to form each round,<br />
If rusted iron or mouldering wood<br />
Is the fragile frame, you must make it good.<br />
You must build it over and fashion it strong,<br />
Though the task be hard as your life is long;<br />
For up this ladder the pathway leads<br />
To earthly pleasures and spirit needs;<br />
And all that may come in another way<br />
Shall be but illusion, and will not stay.</p>
<p class="poetry">In useless effort, then, waste no time;<br />
Rebuild your ladder, and climb and climb.</p>

<p class="poetry">Who is a Christian in this Christian land<br />
Of many churches and of lofty spires?<br />

Bought by the profits of unholy greed,<br />

Not he who sends petitions from the lips<br />
That lie to-morrow in the street and mart.<br />
Not he who fattens on another&rsquo;s toil,<br />
And flings his unearned riches to the poor,<br />
Or aids the heathen with a lessened wage,<br />
And builds cathedrals with an increased rent.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; For the tinsel of a name?</p>
<p class="poetry">We are hurrying all together<br />

Intent on plunder.&nbsp; Suddenly a sound&mdash;<br />

With Justice for their motto, they reflect<br />
The mighty force of God&rsquo;s Omnipotence.<br />
And nothing stands before them.&nbsp; Lusty Greed,<br />

Wrong.</p>

great are the truths they see;<br />
And the heart of the world is singing a song, and its burden is

Brave January, beauteous May and June,<br />

All, all save one, have left me for that bourne<br />
Men call the Past.&nbsp; It seems but yesterday<br />
I saw fair August, laughing with the Sea,<br />
Snaring the Earth with her seductive wiles,<br />
And making conquest, even of the Sun.<br />
Yet has she gone, and left me here to mourn.&rsquo;<br />
Then spake December, from an open door:<br />

Touching the borders of the Unseen Realms<br />
And bringing down to earth their mystic fires<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; And though Justice still is blind,<br />
Time&rsquo;s beyond is always better<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the paths he leaves behind.</p>
<p class="poetry">In our eons of existence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As we circle through the night,<br />
We annihilate the distance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twixt the darkness and the light.<br />
From beginnings crude and lowly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Round and round our souls have trod<br />
Through the circles, winding slowly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to knowledge and to God.</p>

IS A PRIVILEGE</h2>
<p class="poetry">Life is a privilege.&nbsp; Its youthful days<br
/>
Shine with the radiance of continuous Mays.<br />
To live, to breathe, to wonder and desire,<br />
To feed with dreams the heart&rsquo;s perpetual fire;<br />
To thrill with virtuous passions and to glow<br />
With great ambitions&mdash;in one hour to know<br />
The depths and heights of feeling&mdash;God! in truth<br />
How beautiful, how beautiful is youth!</p>
<p class="poetry">Life is a privilege.&nbsp; Like some rare
rose<br />
The mysteries of the human mind unclose.<br />
What marvels lie in earth and air and sea,<br />
What stores of knowledge wait our opening key,<br />
What sunny roads of happiness lead out<br />
Beyond the realms of indolence and doubt,<br />
And what large pleasures smile upon and bless<br />
The busy avenues of usefulness.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>Life is a privilege.&nbsp; Though noontide fades<br />
And shadows fall along the winding glades;<br />
Though joy-blooms wither in the autumn air,<br />
Yet the sweet scent of sympathy is there.<br />
Pale sorrow leads us closer to our kind,<br />
And in the serious hours of life we find<br />
Depths in the soul of men which lend new worth<br />
And majesty to this brief span of earth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Life is a privilege.&nbsp; If some sad fate<br
/>
Sends us alone to seek the exit gate;<br />
If men forsake us as the shadows fall,<br />
Still does the supreme privilege of all<br />
Come in that reaching upward of the soul<br />
To find the welcoming presence at the goal,<br />
And in the knowledge that our feet have trod<br />
Paths that lead from and must lead back to God.</p>

AN OLD ART GALLERY</h2>
<p class="poetry">Before the statue of a giant Hun,<br />
There stood a dwarf, misshapen and uncouth.<br />
His lifted eyes seemed asking: &lsquo;Why, in sooth,<br />
Was I not fashioned like this mighty one?<br />
Would God show favour to an older son<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like earthly kings, and beggar without ruth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another, who sinned only by his youth?<br />
Why should two lives in such divergence run?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Strange, as he gazed, that from a vanished
past<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No memories revived of war and strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of misused prowess, and of broken
law.<br />
That old Hun&rsquo;s spirit, in the dwarf re-cast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lived out the sequence of an earthly life.<br />

<p class="poetry">Among the virile hosts he passed along,<br />
Conspicuous for an undetermined grace<br />
Of sexless beauty.&nbsp; In his form and face<br />
God&rsquo;s mighty purpose somehow had gone wrong.<br />
Then on his loom, he wove a careful song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of sensuous threads; a wordy web of lace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein the primal passions of the race<br />
And his own sins made wonder for the throng.</p>
<p class="poetry">A little pen prick opened up a vein,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave the finished mesh a crimson blot&mdash;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last consummate touch of

&nbsp;&nbsp; Looked through and through the pattern and found

<p class="poetry">When God had formed the Universe, He thought<br

Of all the marvels therein to be wrought<br />
And to His aid then Motherhood was brought.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;My lesser self, the feminine of Me,<br

She will go forth throughout all time,&rsquo; quoth He,<br />
&lsquo;And make My world what I would have it be.</p>

And for a cycle of repose would go<br />
Into that silence which but God may know.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Therefore I leave the rounding of My

To Motherhood; and that which I began<br />
Let woman finish in perfecting man.</p>

She is the sun, that calls the seed to earth.<br />
She is the gardener, who knows its worth.</p>

Divine the growth such seed and soil will bring.<br />
For all is Me, and I am everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus having spoken to Himself aloud,<br />
His glorious face upon His breast He bowed,<br />
And sought repose behind a wall of cloud.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come forth, O God! though great Thy thought and

In shaping woman for true Motherhood,<br />
Lord, speak again; she has not understood.</p>

The earth is peopled with a mighty throng,<br />
Yet men are fighting and the world goes wrong.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lord, speak again, ere yet it be too late,<br

Unloved, unwanted souls come through earth&rsquo;s gate:<br />
The unborn child is given a dower of hate.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy world progresses in all ways save one.<br

In Motherhood, for which it was begun,<br />
Lord, Lord, behold how little has been done!</p>
<p class="poetry">Children are spawned like fishes in the

With ignorance and crime they fill the land.<br />
Lord, speak again, till mothers understand.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Conception pleasure or deliverance woe.<br />
Who plants the seed should help the shoot to grow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Better a barren soil than weed and tare,<br />
Or sickly plants that die for want of care<br />
In poisonous jungles, void of sun and air.</p>
<p class="poetry">True Motherhood is not alone to breed<br />
The human race; it is to know and heed<br />
Its holiest purpose and its highest need.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lord, speak again, so woman shall be stirred<br

With the full meaning of that mighty word<br />
True Motherhood.&nbsp; She has not rightly heard.</p>

Unsatisfied with what tradition taught.</p>

And in the centre I made God a throne.</p>
<p class="poetry">And this dear heaven I set within my heart,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; And carried it about with me alway,<br />

Seemed alien to my thoughts and held no part.</p>

<p class="poetry">On a bleak, bald hill with a dull world
under,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dreary world of the Commonplace,<br />
I have stood when the whole world seemed a blunder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of dotard Time, in an aimless race.<br />
With worry about me and want before me&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet deep in my soul was a rapture spring<br />
That made me cry to the grey sky o&rsquo;er me:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I know this life is a goodly
thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I have given sweet years to a thankless duty<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; While cold and starving, though clothed and fed,<br
/>
For a young heart&rsquo;s hunger for joy and beauty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is harder to bear than the need of bread.<br />
I have watched the wane of a sodden season,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which let hope wither, and made care thrive,<br />
And through it all, without earthly reason,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have thrilled with the glory of being alive.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Where love and beauty feed heart and eye.<br />
The brilliant light of the sun grows tender<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As it slants to the shore of the by and by.<br />
I prize each hour as a golden treasure&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A pearl Time drops from a broken string:<br />
And all my ways are the ways of pleasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I know this life is a goodly thing.</p>
<p class="poetry">And I know, too, that not in the seeing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or having, or doing the things we would,<br />
Lies that deep rapture that comes from being<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>At one with the Purpose which made all
good</i>.<br />
And not from Pleasure the heart may borrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That rare contentment for which we strive,<br />
Unless through trouble, and want, and sorrow<br />

STATUE</h2>
<p class="poetry">A granite rock in the mountain side<br />
Gazed on the world and was satisfied.<br />
It watched the centuries come and go.<br />
It welcomed the sunlight, yet loved the snow.<br />
It grieved when the forest was forced to fall,<br />
Yet joyed when steeples rose, white and tall,<br />
In the valley below it, and thrilled to hear<br />
The voice of the great town roaring near.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the mountain stream from its idle play<br

Was caught by the mill wheel and borne away<br />
And trained to labour, the grey rock mused<br />
&lsquo;Trees and verdure and stream are used<br />
By Man the Master; but I remain<br />
Friend of the mountain, and star, and plain,<br />
Unchanged forever by God&rsquo;s decree,<br />
While passing centuries bow to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Out of the mountain was wrenched the rock.<br />
Bruised and battered and broken in heart,<br />
It was carried away to the common mart,<br />
Wrecked and ruined in piece and pride.<br />
&lsquo;Oh, God is cruel,&rsquo; the granite cried,<br />
&lsquo;Comrade of mountains, of stars the friend,<br />
By all deserted, how sad my end.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">A dreaming sculptor in passing by<br />
Gazed at the granite with thoughtful eye.<br />
Then stirred with a purpose supremely grand<br />
He bade his dream in the rock expand.<br />
And lo! from the broken and shapeless mass<br />
That grieved and doubted, it came to pass<br />
That a glorious statue of priceless worth<br />
And infinite beauty, adorned the earth.</p>

Look to the Great Eternal Cause<br />

Look in; and learn the wrong, and right,<br />
From your own soul&rsquo;s unwritten laws.<br />

To one who knocks, each door unlocks;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he who seeks, shall find.</p>

172</span>PRAYER</h2>
<p class="poetry">Lean on thyself until thy strength is tried;<br
/>
Then ask God&rsquo;s help; it will not be denied.</p>
<p class="poetry">Use thine own sight to see the way to go;<br />
When darkness falls ask God the path to show.</p>
<p class="poetry">Think for thyself and reason out thy plan;<br
/>
God has His work and thou hast thine, oh, man.</p>
<p class="poetry">Exert thy will and use it for control;<br />
God gave thee jurisdiction of thy soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">All thine immortal powers bring into play;<br
/>
Think, act, strive, reason, then look up and pray.</p>
<h2><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>CLIMBING</h2>
<p class="poetry">Who climbs the mountain does not always
climb.<br />
The winding road slants downward many a time;<br />
Yet each descent is higher than the last.<br />
Has thy path fallen?&nbsp; That will soon be past.<br />
Beyond the curve the way leads up and on.<br />
Think not thy goal forever lost or gone.<br />
Keep moving forward; if thine aim is right<br />
Thou canst not miss the shining mountain height.<br />
Who would attain to summits still and fair,<br />
Must nerve himself through valleys of despair.</p>

<p class="poetry">&lsquo;There is no death, there are no
dead.&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From zone to zone, from sphere to sphere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The souls of all who pass from here<br />
By hosts of living thoughts are led;<br />
And dark or bright, those souls must tread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The paths they fashioned year on year.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For hells are built of hate or fear,<br />
And heavens of love our lives have shed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Across unatlassed worlds of space,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through God&rsquo;s mighty universe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With thoughts that bless or thoughts that curse,<br
/>
Each journeys to his rightful place.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, greater truth no man has said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no death, there are no
dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>It lifts the mourner from the sod,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bids him cast away the reed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of some uncomforting poor creed,<br />
And walk with Knowledge for a rod.<br />
It bids the doubter seek the broad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vast fields, where living facts will feed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All those whose patience proves their need<br />
Of these immortal truths of God.</p>
<p class="poetry">It brings before the eyes of faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those realms of radiance, tier on tier,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where our beloved &lsquo;dead&rsquo; appear,<br />
More beautiful because of &lsquo;death.&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It speaks to grief: &lsquo;Be comforted;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no death, there are no dead.&rsquo;</p>

176</span>REALISATION</h2>
<p class="poetry">Hers was a lonely, shadowed lot;<br />
Or so the unperceiving thought,<br />
Who looked no deeper than her face,<br />
Devoid of chiselled lines of grace&mdash;<br />
No farther than her humble grate,<br />
And wondered how she bore her fate.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet she was neither lone nor sad;<br />
So much of love her spirit had,<br />
She found an ever-flowing spring<br />
Of happiness in everything.</p>
<p class="poetry">So near to her was Nature&rsquo;s heart<br />
It seemed a very living part<br />
Of her own self; and bud and blade,<br />
And heat and cold, and sun and shade,<br />
And dawn and sunset, Spring and Fall,<br />
Held raptures for her, one and all.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>The year&rsquo;s four changing seasons brought<br />
To her own door what thousands sought<br />
In wandering ways and did not find&mdash;<br />
Diversion and content of mind.</p>
<p class="poetry">She loved the tasks that filled each
day&mdash;<br />
Such menial duties; but her way<br />
Of looking at them lent a grace<br />
To things the world deemed commonplace.</p>
<p class="poetry">Obscure and without place or name,<br />
She gloried in another&rsquo;s fame.<br />
Poor, plain and humble in her dress,<br />
She thrilled when beauty and success<br />
And wealth passed by, on pleasure bent;<br />
They made earth seem so opulent.<br />
Yet none of quicker sympathy,<br />
When need or sorrow came, than she.<br />
And so she lived, and so she died.</p>
<p class="poetry">She woke as from a dream.&nbsp; How wide<br />
And wonderful the avenue<br />
That stretched to her astonished view!<br />
And up the green ascending lawn<br />
A palace caught the rays of dawn.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>Then suddenly the silence stirred<br />
With one clear keynote of a bird;<br />
A thousand answered, till ere long<br />
The air was quivering bits of song.<br />
She rose and wandered forth in awe,<br />
Amazed and moved by all she saw,<br />
For, like so many souls who go<br />
Away from earth, she did not know<br />
The cord was severed.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down
the street,<br />
With eager arms stretched forth to greet,<br />
Came one she loved and mourned in youth;<br />
Her mother followed; then the truth<br />
Broke on her, golden wave on wave,<br />
Of knowledge infinite.&nbsp; The grave,<br />
The body and the earthly sphere<br />
Were gone!&nbsp; Immortal life was here!<br />
They led her through the Palace halls;<br />
From gleaming mirrors on the walls<br />
She saw herself, with radiant mien,<br />
And robed in splendour like a queen,<br />
While glory round about her shone.<br />
&lsquo;All this,&rsquo; Love murmured, &lsquo;is your
own.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>And when she gazed with wondering eye,<br />
And questioned whence and where and why,<br />
Love answered thus: &lsquo;All Heaven is made<br />
By thoughts on earth; your walls were laid,<br />
Year after year, of purest gold;<br />
The beauty of your mind behold<br />
In this fair palace; ay, and more<br />
Waits farther on, so vast your store.<br />
I was not worthy when I died<br />
To take my place here at your side;<br />
I toiled through long and weary years<br />
From lower planes to these high spheres;<br />
And through the love you sent from earth<br />
I have attained a second birth.<br />
Oft when my erring soul would tire<br />
I felt the strength of your desire;<br />
I heard you breathe my name in prayer,<br />
And courage conquered weak despair.<br />
Ah! earth needs heaven, but heaven indeed<br />
Of earth has just as great a need.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Across the terrace with a bound<br />
There sped a lambkin and a hound<br />
(Dumb comrades of the old earth land)<br />
And fondled her caressing hand.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>&lsquo;YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE&rsquo;<br />
Was answered to her questioning eyes;<br />
&lsquo;You taught them love; love has no end!<br />
Nor does love&rsquo;s life on form depend.<br />
If there be mortal without love,<br />
He wakes to no new life above.<br />
If love in humbler things exist,<br />
It must through other realms persist<br />
Until all love rays merge in HIM.<br />
Hark!&nbsp; Hear the heavenly Cherubim!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then hushed and awed, with joy so vast<br />
It knew no future and no past,<br />
She stood amidst the radiant throng<br />
That came to swell love&rsquo;s welcoming song&mdash;<br />
This humble soul from earth&rsquo;s far coast<br />
The centre of the heavenly host.</p>
<p class="poetry">On earth they see her grave and say:<br />
&lsquo;She lies there till the judgment day;&rsquo;<br />
Nor dream, so limited their thought,<br />
What miracles by love are wrought.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
